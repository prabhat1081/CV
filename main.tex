\cventry{May-Jul 2016}{Summer Analyst}{}{Goldman Sachs Group, Inc}{}{
\begin{description}
  \item[$\bullet$] Developed a module system, following JDK9’s module specifications, for firm’s platform based on JDK8 providing interoperability between several JVM languages and firm’s proprietary language.
  \item[$\bullet$] The module system provides means to organize code, to have encapsulation, communication contract and loose coupling between modules leading to enhanced platform scalability, integrity and performance.
  \item[$\bullet$] Designed a JSON specification to define a module's communication contract, including its exposed interfaces and dependencies.
  \item[$\bullet$] Enhanced the platform’s distributed build system to enforce the module’s communication contract during build, ensuring reliable configuration.
  \item[$\bullet$] Built a runtime system using Java class-loader hierarchy to enforce encapsulation at runtime and provide loose coupling.
